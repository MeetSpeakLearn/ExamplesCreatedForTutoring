import enum

# Enumeration of cash types. This enumeration plays no current role, beyond its types being associated
# with units within currencies. I've included this because I assume I will leverage off of it later.
# I plan a future extension where a currency is associated with a cash drawer and the cash drawer's
# inventory records the number of bills and coins of each unit type. Many currencies have coins and
# notes with the same face value. For example, there exists both a $1 note and a $1 coin in US currency.
# It may become useful to distingish between the two when paying out cash. For example, one type may have
# special uses that the other type does not. A person may prefer one form over the other. A store may
# wish not get rid of one form as quickly as it can because some customers may shun it.
# There also exists the possibility of local currencies that stand in for another currency on a
# one to one basis. The Panamanian Balboa is an example. The Balboa is issued by the government of Panama,
# though the official currency is the US dollar. One balboa equals one dollar. A business may wish to get
# rid of balboas in favor of retaining dollars. Distinguishing between these things may be useful. Thus,
# there may be more than one kind of note for the value within the defacto currency of a location.
# The choice of which to dole out may not be insignificant, depending upon the circumstances.
# A customer may wish to be paid only in coins, if that customer needs coins for vending machines,
# for example. It make sense to add this type from the beginning, even if we do not yet use it.
class NoteOrCoin(enum.Enum):
    COIN = 0
    NOTE = 1

# This class will be expanded in the future. At the moment, it only contains two kinds of information:
#   A breakdown of the kinds of monetary instruments that may be paid out in a currency and a value
#   indicating a decimal factor for converting external values to internal values.
#   All amounts associated with monetary instruments are stored in the lowest unit of the currency.
#   For the US dollar, this is the cent. Thus, all amounts stored and associated with the various bills
#   and coins is expressed in cents. The decimal value allows us to convert from $100 dollars to
#   10,000 cents by multiplying by self.decimal, which is 100 for the US dollar. Some currencies use
#   three decimal places. For those, self.decimal would be 1000, etc.
